% # CaBuffer_TRN: Calcium buffer concentration dynamics, for generic
%     thalamic reticular cells used in the DynaSim implementation of (Bazhenov
%     et al., 2002). Note that in the original code, this celltype is called
%     RE, and this mechanism is identified as ICa, even though it is not a
%     current.

% Parameters
tauR = 5         % ms
Ca_inf = 0.00024 % mM of calcium, aka 2.4e-4
D = 1            % unitless conversion factor, unclear purpose
% See "Interneuron-mediated inhibition synchronizes neuronal activity during slow
%     oscillation" Chen et al., 2012, Equation 5:
A = 10/(2*96489) % mM cm^2/(ms uA) drive conversion of Ca-modifying currents
CaBufferIC = 0.000001
CaBufferNoiseIC = 0.0001

% ODEs
% In original code, the CaBuffer requires input only from IT_RE
CaBuffer_TRN' = max(-A.*@IT_TRN./D, 0) + (Ca_inf - CaBuffer_TRN)./tauR
CaBuffer_TRN(0) = CaBufferIC+CaBufferNoiseIC.*rand(1,Npop)

% Interface
@CaBuffer_TRN += CaBuffer_TRN
